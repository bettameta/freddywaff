### Social Media Icons/Menu ###

You can add social media icons to the Social menu. You can simply add your social profile URL and the icons will appear automatically.


### Featured Images ###

This theme relies heavily on Featured Images. All the featured images appear on the home and archive pages where you can scroll horizontaly. On single entry pages, the Featured Image will be set as the header image. If your post is missing a Featured Image, the custom header image will be shown. If the custom header is missing, it won't show anything.

To choose the image you want to set as a featured image for this post and click the *Set as Featured Image* button. For best results use images that are at least 960 pixels wide.
